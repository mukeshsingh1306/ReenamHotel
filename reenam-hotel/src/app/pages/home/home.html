			<h2>Welcome to Reenam Hotel</h2>
			<p>
				From the moment you arrive, the hotel is set up to feel like a comfortable base in Leh rather than a
				formal city property. Rooms are simply furnished, centrally heated and planned so you can warm up, unpack and
				look out towards the surrounding hills.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being close to the main market and on the way towards Lamdon School means you can step out for shopping,
				cafés and short walks, then return quickly when the temperature drops. Many guests use the hotel as their
				starting point for Leh Palace, Shanti Stupa and nearby monasteries.
			</p>
			<p>
				A small team looks after day-to-day details – warm rooms, fresh linen, simple meals and local guidance – so you
				can focus on your Ladakh plans.
