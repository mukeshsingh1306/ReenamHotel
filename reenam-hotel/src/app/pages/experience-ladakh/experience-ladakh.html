			you good value without cutting back on the essentials. Rooms are clean, centrally heated and thoughtfully
			planned so you can rest well between drives and sightseeing.

			Most rooms come with the practical touches you need in the mountains – warm bedding, attached bathrooms,
			reliable hot water and enough storage space for winter layers and travel gear. The idea is to keep things

			The team can also help connect you to trusted local taxis, simple restaurants and day trips so you can
			plan your Leh–Ladakh days without having to research everything from scratch.
		</p>
		<p>

			dishes to familiar Indian and continental options – so you can eat well and head out again without
			worrying about where to find your next meal.
